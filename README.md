# RewardBot

Discord reward bot, allows you to run commands in game at preset times for members with appropriate Discord roles.

For example, you can reward your Discord Boosters on specified day(s) of the month with Ores, Ingots, Components... etc.
Works best with CrunchUtils !giveitem command but will also work with any other command that players or staff can run in-game.
